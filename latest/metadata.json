Each field that contains an enumerated value is followed by a request for the human readable value. Depending ono the nature of the content of the field, this human readable value is either a description, or a recognised identifier. The data returned is not exhaustive, but is intended to demonstrate what kind of data is available, how to apply filters to constrain the response where multiple records are returned, and how to expand enumerated values.\n",
